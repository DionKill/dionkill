# Hello!
Dion here.

I don't know what to write here, I'm not good with introductions...
This is my GitHub. I may or may not make things and publish them on here.

## Who the hell are you anyways?
I'm an italian dude who just wastes his free time instead of studying.
Things I like:
 * 🍕 Pizza
 * 🐈 Cats
 * 🎮 Games
 * 🖥️ Generally modding/tinkering with tech
 * ✅ Privacy. It's a lot that I'm putting my real name on here for university...
 * ⌨️ Open source projects :D

## Anything about your repos?
Yes! The times of cloning repos and then abandoning them is over. I've made SOME functional stuff, you can take a look at the pinned repos to get an idea!

And that's about it cya
