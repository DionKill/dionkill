# Hello!
Dion here.

I don't know what to write here, I'm not good with introductions...
This is my GitHub. I may or may not make things and publish them on here.

## Who the hell are you anyways?
I'm an italian dude who just wastes his free time instead of studying.
Things I like:
 * 🍕 Pizza
 * 🐈 Cats
 * 🎮 Games
 * 🖥️ Generally modding/tinkering with tech
 * ✅ Privacy. It's a lot that I'm putting my real name on here for Uni...
 * ⌨️ Open source projects :D

## Anything about your repos?
For now I've only been cloning repos and doing similar stuff, mostly for personal projects. None of them have been completed however (bruh).

And that's about it cya
